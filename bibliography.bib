	abstract = {Sampling of a population is frequently required to understand trends and patterns in natural resource management because financial and time constraints preclude a complete census. A rigorous probability-based survey design specifies where to sample so that inferences from the sample apply to the entire population. Probability survey designs should be used in natural resource and environmental management situations because they provide the mathematical foundation for statistical inference. Development of long-term monitoring designs demand survey designs that achieve statistical rigor and are efficient but remain flexible to inevitable logistical or practical constraints during field data collection. Here we describe an approach to probability-based survey design, called the Reversed Randomized Quadrant-Recursive Raster, based on the concept of spatially balanced sampling and implemented in a geographic information system. This provides environmental managers a practical tool to generate flexible and efficient survey designs for natural resource applications. Factors commonly used to modify sampling intensity, such as categories, gradients, or accessibility, can be readily incorporated into the spatially balanced sample design.},

Clarification of interrelationships and redundancy is needed to guide metric selection and interpretation for the purpose of landscape monitoring. In this study we identified independent components of class- and landscape-level structure in multiple landscapes in each of three large and geographically disjunct study areas. We used {FRAGSTATS} and principal components analysis ({PCA}) to identify independent components of landscape structure, and cluster analysis to group the components. We then calculated the universality, strength, and consistency of the identified landscape structure components. At the class-level we identified 24 independent configuration components. Seven of these components were nearly universal and consistent in interpreted meaning. At the landscape-level there were 17 independent structure components. Eight of these components were universal and consistent. These results indicate that there are consistent combinations of metrics that universally describe the major attributes of landscape structure at the class- and landscape-levels.},

	abstract = {Although habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide, virtually no attention has been paid to the quantification of error in fragmentation statistics. Landscape pattern indices ({LPIs}), such as mean patch size and number of patches, are routinely used to quantify fragmentation and are often calculated using remote-sensing imagery that has been classified into different land-cover classes. No classified map is ever completely correct, so we asked if different maps with similar misclassification rates could result in widely different errors in pattern indices. We simulated landscapes with varying proportions of habitat and clumpiness (autocorrelation) and then simulated classification errors on the same maps. We simulated higher misclassification at patch edges (as is often observed), and then used a smoothing algorithm routinely used on images to correct salt-and-pepper classification error. We determined how well classification errors (and smoothing) corresponded to errors seen in four pattern indices. Maps with low misclassification rates often yielded errors in {LPIs} of much larger magnitude and substantial variability. Although smoothing usually improved classification error, it sometimes increased {LPI} error and reversed the direction of error in {LPIs} introduced by misclassification. Our results show that classification error is not always a good predictor of errors in {LPIs}, and some types of image postprocessing (for example, smoothing) might result in the underestimation of habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, our results suggest that there is potential for large errors in nearly every landscape pattern analysis ever published, because virtually none quantify the errors in {LPIs} themselves.},

	abstract = {Multiscale spatial patterns of forest reference conditions offer insight on how historical and environmental processes have influenced forest stand dynamics. Yet, spatial information is often either unavailable or partial, because many studies provide nonspatial reference condition information, whereas others only report the local (i.e. observed at plot extent) spatial arrangement of trees. However, knowledge of multiscaled spatial patterns, including stand-, among-patch-, and within-patch-level patterns, is needed to ensure that forest management strategies suit a wide range of objectives in ecosystem restoration. In this study, we propose a new framework for delineating tree patches based on common stand attributes. We found that patch reference conditions for presettlement ponderosa pine in northern Arizona ranged from 10 to 27 patches/ha, accounted for 62–75\% of the total historic stand basal area (m2/ha) and varied in size from 0.01 to 0.15 ha. Lastly, discussion was made on the importance of using a patch-delineation framework, such as the one proposed in this study, as a basis for quantifying stand- and patch-level patterns of reconstructed presettlement and current forest conditions and how this information should guide spatially explicit restoration management (e.g. thinning prescriptions).},

	abstract = {Landscape pattern is spatially correlated and scale-dependent. Thus, understanding landscape structure and functioning requires multiscale information, and scaling functions are the most precise and concise way of quantifying multiscale characteristics explicitly. The major objective of this study was to explore if there are any scaling relations for landscape pattern when it is measured over a range of scales (grain size and extent). The results showed that the responses of landscape metrics to changing scale fell into two categories when computed at the class level (i.e., for individual land cover types): simple scaling functions and unpredictable behavior. Similarly, three categories were found at the landscape level, with the third being staircase pattern, in a previous study when all land cover types were combined together. In general, scaling relations were more variable at the class level than at the landscape level, and more consistent and predictable with changing grain size than with changing extent at both levels. Considering that the landscapes under study were quite diverse in terms of both composition and configuration, these results seem robust. This study highlights the need for multiscale analysis in order to adequately characterize and monitor landscape heterogeneity, and provides insights into the scaling of landscape patterns.},

Analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of changing pixel size on landscape metrics. The results indicate that landscape metrics should not be dramatically affected by the change in pixel size up to 80m, provided that identical land cover classifications could be generated by sensors with different spatial resolving powers (e.g. Landsat-{TM} and {MSS}).},

These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery.

In this study regions were classified as belonging to any one of nine classes: residential, commercial/industrial, mobile home, water, dry land, runway/taxiway, aircraft parking, multilane highway, and vehicle parking. The classes were selected so that they directly relate to the Defense Mapping Agency's Mapping, Charting and Geodesy tangible features. To attack the problem a statistical segmentation procedure was devised. The primitive operators used to drive the segmentation are texture measures derived from cooccurrence matrices. The segmentation procedure considers three kinds of regions at each level of the segmentation: uniform, boundary, and unspecified. At every level the procedure differentiates uniform regions from boundary and unspecified regions. In the assigns a class label to the uniform regions. The boundary and unspecified regions are split to form higher level regions. The methodologies involved are mathematically developed as a series of hypothesis tests. While only a one-level segmentation was performed studies are described which show the capabilities of each of these hypothesis tests. In particular an 83\% correct classification was obtained in testing the labeling procedure. These studies indicate that the proposed procedure should be useful for land use classifications as well as other problems.},

In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association ({LISA}) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The {LISA} statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify “outliers,” as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a {LISA} statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},
